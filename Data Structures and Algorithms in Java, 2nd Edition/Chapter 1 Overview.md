## 数据结构和算法的定义

A data structure is an arrangement of data in a computer’s memory (or sometimes on a disk). Data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables, among others. Algorithms manipulate the data in these structures in various ways, such as searching for a particular data item and sorting the data.

## 有哪些数据结构

| Data Structure | Advantages                               | Disadvantages                            |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Array          | Quick insertion, very fast access if index known. | Slow search, slow deletion, fixed size.  |
| Ordered array  | Quicker search than unsorted array.      | Slow insertion and deletion, fixed size. |
| Stack          | Provides last-in, first-out access.      | Slow access to other items.              |
| Queue          | Provides first-in, first-out access.     | Slow access to other items.              |
| Linked list    | Quick insertion, quick deletion.         | Slow search.                             |
| Binary tree    | Quick search, insertion, deletion (if tree remains balanced). | Deletion algorithm is complex.           |
| Red-black tree | Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced. | Complex.                                 |
| 2-3-4 tree     | Quick search, insertion, deletion. Tree always balanced. Similar trees good for disk storage. | Complex.                                 |
| Hash table     | Very fast access if key known. Fast insertion. | Slow deletion, access slow if key not known, inefficient memory usage. |
| Heap           | Fast insertion, deletion, access to largest item. | Slow access to other items.              |
| Graph          | Models real-world situations.            | Some algorithms are slow and complex.    |
